**2 PLAYERS | AGES 10+ | 15 MINUTES

Welcome to ⟨B|raket|S⟩! The object is to close **brakets**, the tools of the quantum mechanic! You’ll need to create these quantum brakets to maximize your probability of winning. But, just like quantum physics, there is no complete certainty of the winner until the **measurement** is made!

No knowledge of quantum mechanics is require to play the game, but you will learn the calculus of the quantum as you play. Later in the rules, you’ll find out how your moves line up with the laws of quantum physics.

## What you need

**A deck of ⟨B|raket|S⟩ cards, a coin, and a way to keep score.**

The instructions are [here](instructions/Brakets.pdf).

I suggest getting the cards printed professionally. All the cards images are in the [images folder](images/). I printed the cards pictured above in Canada using https://printerstudio.ca. However, they also have a worldwide site (https://printerstudio.com). 

You can print your own cards using a desktop printer with [this file](cards/pieces_dot.pdf).

You can laser cut your own pieces using [this file](vectors/laser_cut_me.svg).
